     <p><strong>Drug Addiction in Orange County </strong></p>
<p>A true story: Last January, an Orange County high school PTA meeting featured a narcotics officer from the local police force who was invited to speak to parents on the state of teen drug use.</p>
<p>In the audience was a member of the local school board, who reported on the evening during a public school board meeting a few days later. Here is what she said:</p>
<p><em> “I was at the [high school] PTA meeting last week. The presentation was orchestrated by officer [name] but he brought with him a narcotics officer from [Orange County city] and it was a real eye-opener for the parents there. But I think it’s something that parents throughout our district need to be aware of because some people want to deny that there is a drug problem here.</em></p>
<p><em>“But when you bring a narcotics officer … and he’s saying ‘drugs are rampant in [city]’ and it used to be that marijuana was the socially acceptable drug. But the drug of choice now is heroin. There are kids using heroin and that’s not easy to get them off of it.</em></p>
<p><em>“And they get addicted quickly. And he said everybody he’s talked to who is on harder drugs started on marijuana. Before that they got Oxycontin, they got Adderol, they got Vicodin from their own home.”</em></p>
<p>The school board member learned something that night that we at Reflections Recovery Center have known for years: Drug addiction is no longer the sleazy habit of the lower classes of society. Today, thanks to an explosion in the number of legal prescriptions for opiates and other addictive drugs, addiction is sharply on the rise.</p>
<p>The school board member was so affected by the meeting that she initiated a program to inform parents that drug addiction often starts in their own home with the prescription medications found in their medicine cabinet.</p>
